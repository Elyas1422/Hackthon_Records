# Hackthons Records
 
This application enables administrators to easily track the participation of students in external Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions and hackathons. With this app, users can store information about the name, website, and date of each competition, as well as a list of participating students. For each student, their ID, name, major, ranking in the competition, and team information (if applicable) can be recorded.
